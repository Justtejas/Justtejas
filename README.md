 <h2>Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Tejas Pantoji</h2>
 
<b>I started my software journey building programs in C, C++ and Java while I was completing my Diploma. Started web development while pursuing my Bachelor's Degree in 2022 and have since enjoyed developing backend tools and APIs in JavaScript, Go and C#.
I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering in June 2024. I'd love to work at a startup in a tight knit team where I can make an impact quickly. If you're hiring, let's chat!
